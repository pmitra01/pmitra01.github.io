The hope is that at some point, this blog will be an introduction to who I am, or who I want you to think I am. 
Although, I hope it is truer than that - and self-indulgently lets me explore and stay honest to learning and 
processing.


Along the professional dimension, I practice and think about ML. I specialise in ML
applications for knowledge discovery from text.
