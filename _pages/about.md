Along the professional dimension, I practice and think about ML. I specialise in ML applications for knowledge 
discovery from text. Most recently I have been working on conversational search for healthcare professionals.

I use this blog-post to explore ideas, and write about experiments - both related to my profession, and away from it.
The hope is that it keeps honest in exploring curiosities and evolving my ideas.
